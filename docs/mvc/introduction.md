## 101

In this first session, I will explain what is "Harmony". Harmony is not as good as other existing frameworks, the main purpose of making this framework to simplify my work as a Web Developer. Harmony actually is a Modern Slim Boilerplate.

## Why do I create a Harmony Framework?

Since I did not have the ability to learn fast, I was very old to understand something. Therefore I created the Harmony to make it easier for me to work. Although beyond that I also often find projects that have to use a variety of popular frameworks.

## What i need to start using Harmony?

Harmony Framework pre-requirement :
- PHP version "^5.5.9 or >=7.0.8"
- Composer (is Dependency Manager for PHP)
- Node JS also NPM coming from.

_The concept is quite simple from the Harmony Framework is a path that insha Allah can make it easier for other developers to understand it, and very friendly with beginner developers._
